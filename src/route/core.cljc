  "Fragment routing for kotoba-lang single-page apps. Pure `.cljc`, stdlib +
  jp-go-dds only, no I/O and no browser API in this namespace.

  WHY IT IS A LIBRARY. kotoba-lang UI is single-page apps (ADR-2608080100): one
  document, one bundle, one mount, and moving between screens changes state rather
  than location. Three apps arrived at the same ~76-line file to do it —
  `kami-app-daw`, `kami-app-nle`, `kami-app-suji` — and the first two differ from
  each other by six lines, five of which are the view table and one of which is a
  word in a docstring. The `kotoba-uiux` skill names the third app as the moment
  to extract, and this is it. Not into `jp-go-dds`, because routing is neither
  markup nor CSS.

  THE TWO INVARIANTS THIS EXISTS TO KEEP.

  **Views are data, and the nav is generated from them.** A view added to the
  dispatch and forgotten in the nav is dead code that looks live; generating the
  nav from the same table removes the possibility rather than asking anybody to
  remember. `check-views` refuses a table that cannot hold this up.

  **The fragment, not a path.** These apps are served by static hosts (GitHub
  Pages, the cloud-itonami sites plane), where `history.pushState` to `/editor`
  gives a URL that works until the reader reloads it and then 404s. A fragment is
  never sent to the host, so a hash route survives reload, bookmarking and
  sharing with no server rewrite rule. Use `pushState` only where a rewrite
  actually exists — and check, rather than assume."

(defn check-views
  "Validate a view table, returning a vector of problems (empty when it is sound).

  than like a malformed table."
